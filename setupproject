- firstly we created a project named companyejs project in our file explorer 
- we open a  new window to open the new folder when created 
- open a new terminal to generate a package.json 
- to generate our package.json file we have two ways 
    *C:\companyejsproject>npm init  (but it really takes time)
    *C:\companyejsproject>npm init -y (but this is a very fast shortcut to generate our package.json)

Installing the needed dependencies for our application 
We need to install express (which is a backend web framework use for building of our application )
- Functionalities is mainly use for the request and response of our server which is express
By installing this 
C:\companyejsproject>npm install express@4.18.2

Our next dependency will be nodemon
installing like this
C:\companyejsproject>npm install -D nodemon@2.0.20

Difference between Node and Nodemon
We use it in alternative of node (due to the fact that it watches for every changes we make for each milliseconds)

Similarities between node and nodemon
They both are for runtime execution
